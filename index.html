    Full stack web development and python student with a passion for coding.<br><br>
    During the first UK lockdown in 2020, I helped my daughter
    to complete a coding assignment which developed into a much needed
    hobby for both of us during the long days indoors. As I learned with
    my daughter, I began to see the benefit and infinite potential of
    learning to code. It really is the future. I researched adult coding
    courses and found the <strong><a href="https://www.londonappbrewery.com/">London App Brewery</a></strong> where I am currently completing
    the their <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244">Complete Web Development Bootcamp</a></strong>. I hope that learning the
    full-stack will give me a solid foundation to build on as I continue to
    learn new programming languages. I love learning new things and I know
    that web development is a lifelong learning journey.<br><br> I am also working
    through the <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</a></strong>
    from <strong><a href="https://www.londonappbrewery.com/">London App Brewery</a></strong>.
    I have completed several simple programs so far and I really enjoy building on
    the knowledge that I have learned on previous days. The feeling of joy
    that I get when I finally solve a problem that I have been stuck on
    for hours is incredible.<br><br> In the near future I hope to be able to
    participate in opportunities that will provide real-life experience in
    web development and improve my skills.
